## Inspiration

What inspired me to make this app was CoinGecko's website. This was the website that allowed me to learn React. I realized that making a website like CoinGecko will teach me a lot about using React, so I thought it was the perfect idea.

## Challenges

The challenges faced when creating this app where fetching data from CoinGecko's API and setting up the database behind the accounts and ensuring it is secure.

## The Website

CoinDeno Web is a website that tracks cryptocurrencies. You can open an account on this website and build your own portfolio, add your favorite cryptocurrencies, log all the transactions you have made, and log your wallets. This website was built by Vite for React.
